@defmodule[video/base]

Note that not all of the functions in this module are
currently documented.

@section{Bundled Producers}

@defproc[(blank [length (or/c integer? #f)]) producer?]{
 Creates a blank producer of @racket[length] clips.

 If @racket[length] is @racket[#f], then the producer
 generates as many blank frames as its surrounding @racket[multitrack] requires.}

@defproducer[(color [color (or/c string?
                                 (is-a?/c color%)
                                 (list/c byte? byte? byte?))])]{
 Creates a producer that is a solid color.
 @examples[(eval:alts (color "green") (void))
           (eval:alts (color "yellow" #:length 10) (void))
           (eval:alts (color 255 255 0) (void))]}

@defproducer[(image [file (or/c path-string? path?)])]{
 Contents}
              
@defproducer[(clip [file (or/c path-string? path?)])]{
 Stuff}

@section{Video Compositing}

                   [#:transitions transitions (listof field-element?) '()]
                   [#:start start (or/c nonnegative-integer? #f) #f]

                   [#:length length (or/c nonnegative-integer? #f) #f])
         producer?]

                     [#:transitions transitions (listof field-element?) '()]
                     [#:start start (or/c nonnegative-integer? #f) #f]

                     [#:length length (or/c nonnegative-integer? #f) #f])
         producer?]

@defproc[(attach-filter [producer producer?]
                        [filter filter?] ...)
         producer?]

@section{Bundled Transitions}

@deftransition[(fade-transition)
               #:direction s/e]

@deftransition[(composite-transition)
                #:direction t/b]

@section{Bundled Filters}

@defproc[(grayscale-filter) filter?]

@section{Properties}

@defproc[(producer-length [producer (and/c video? converted-video?)])
         number?]{
 Determines the length of the producer in frames.

 Note that this function requires the video to already be
 converted. In the future, this restriction may be lifted.
 Also note that this function uses @tt{MLT}'s length feature, which
 seems to be a bit buggy at times.

 @racket[producer] is the video who's length will be tested.}
